0. Which of the following sorting algorithms are (or can be made) stable?
   (a) mergesort
   (b) quicksort with the first element as pivot
   (c) quicksort with randomized pivot
   (d) selection sort (assuming you've learned it in data structures)
   (e) insertion sort (assuming you've learned it in data structures)
   (f) heap sort 
   
 A:  
   (a) mergesort : stable
   (b) quicksort with the first element as pivot : unstable
   (c) quicksort with randomized pivot : unstable
   (d) selection sort (assuming you've learned it in data structures) : unstable, can be made stable by inserting elements into the first place
   (e) insertion sort (assuming you've learned it in data structures) : stable
   (f) heap sort : unstable
