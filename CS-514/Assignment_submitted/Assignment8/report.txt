0. For the following graphs, decide whether they are
   (1) directed or undirected, (2) dense or sparse, and (3) cyclic or acyclic:

   (a) Facebook undirected, sparse, cyclic
   (b) Twitter directed, sparse, cyclic
   (c) a family - undirected, dense, cyclic
   (d) V=airports, E=direct_flights - directed, sparse, acyclic [DAG]
   (e) a mesh - undirected, sparse, cyclic 
   (f) V=courses, E=prerequisites - directed, sparse, acyclic [DAG]
   (g) a tree - directed, sparse, acyclic
   (h) V=linux_software_packages, E=dependencies - directed, sparse, acyclic [DAG]
   (i) DP subproblems for 0-1 knapsack - directed, sparse, acyclic [DAG]

   Can you name a very big dense graph?
